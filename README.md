Overview of Project:
Objectives: ANALYSIS ON MOVIE REVIEWS
To Develop a sentiment analysis model to classify movie reviews as positive or negative. Use a dataset like the IMDb Movie Reviews dataset for training and testing.

Binary Classification: Logistic regression aims to predict the probability of a binary outcome (e.g., positive vs. negative sentiment).
Model Interpretation: Provide insights into how different features (independent variables) impact the predicted probabilities.
Decision Making: Help in making informed decisions based on the predicted probabilities, often using a threshold (e.g., 0.5) to classify outcomes.
Key Elements of Logistic Regression:
Logistic Function (Sigmoid): The logistic function transforms linear combinations of inputs into probabilities between 0 and 1.
Odds and Log-Odds: Logistic regression models the log-odds of the probability of an event occurring as a linear combination of the predictor variables.
Coefficients (Weights): These represent the influence of each feature on the outcome, allowing for interpretation of the model.
Cost Function (Log Loss): Measures the performance of the model by penalizing incorrect classifications.
Gradient Descent Optimization: Used to minimize the cost function and find the best-fitting model parameters.

Technologies Used for Logistic Regression:
Programming Languages:

Python: Widely used for its simplicity and powerful libraries for machine learning and data analysis.
R: Another popular language for statistical analysis and machine learning.

Libraries and Frameworks in Python:

Scikit-learn: Provides a comprehensive suite of tools for model training, evaluation, and deployment.
LogisticRegression class: For fitting and predicting logistic regression models.
train_test_split: For splitting data into training and testing sets.
TfidfVectorizer or CountVectorizer: For feature extraction from text data.
Metrics modules like accuracy_score, classification_report, and confusion_matrix: For model evaluation.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations and handling arrays.

Statistical Tools:

Statsmodels: For more detailed statistical modeling and analysis, providing comprehensive outputs and diagnostics.
